# InfinityCalc 

Infinity Calc provides simple functions for numbers that are larger than the capacity of a normal calculator.

&#8226;&#8195; Operations supported: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

&#8226;&#8195; Expressions would follow the BODMAS rule of math

&#8226;&#8195; Brackets can be added to change the precedence of operations.

&#8226;&#8195; Themes can be selected. A special Dark theme is added for the night users.

&#8226;&#8195; Number of digits after the decimal point can be set from settings in the app

Let this app enable your phone higher limits of calculations.

If you have a suggestion for what I could have said or done differently, Iâ€™d like to hear it.
